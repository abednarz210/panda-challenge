#Conclusions

Overall, Wright High school perfomed the best, while Bailey High School performed the worst in both math and reading. The spending allocations for these schools $628.00 per student at Bailey versus Wright at $583.00 per student. One possiblity is the enrollment numbers, Bailey had 4976 students, while Wright had only 1800 total students which may result in smaller class size and overall student to teacher ratios which may have a positve outcome for the student body overall. This trend continues when further comparing charter schools to district schools.
